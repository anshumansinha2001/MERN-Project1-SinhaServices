What is JWT?(Web Tokens)

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

JWTs are often used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

Authentication: Verifying the identity of a user or client.

Authorization: Determining what actions a user or client is allowed to perform.

Components of a JWT:

Header: Contains metadata about the token, such as the type of token and the signing algorithm being used.

Payload: Contains claims or statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. Common claims include user ID, username, and expiration time.

Signature: To verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way, a signature is included.
